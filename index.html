        Welcome to my WDD 130 page. I am a student at BYUI. I am currently
        working on my Web Design and Development Certificate. I enjoy learning
        about web design and development. I am excited to learn more about
        creating websites and web applications.

    <p>
        Utah is a beautiful state. It is known for its national parks and
        outdoor activities. I enjoy mountain biking in the mountains of
        Utah. I also enjoy fishing the many lakes and rivers in Utah. I enjoy
        rafting and kayaking in the rivers of Utah.
